# PERSONAL-EXPENSE-TRACKER
This project addresses 
these gaps by presenting a light-weight, browser-based Personal Expense Tracker built with 
standard web technologies—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap 5—while 
leveraging LocalStorage for zero‑dependency data persistence. 
 
Users can add, view, filter, and delete expenses attributed to predefined categories (Food, 
Transport, Shopping, Bills, Other). A dynamic total updates in real time, and a responsive layout 
guarantees usability on devices of all sizes.
